## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Please tell me:

- Name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- How ClearCase relates to your current responsibilities, if relevant.

## Lab Machines

- You will be provided with your own VM with ClearCase installed.
- Your VM will be available for you continuously until approximately 6pm on the last day of class
- Check your VM assignment in the VM directory of this repository.
- Ensure you disconnect from your VM if you are going to connect from another location — the VM connection does *not* automatically break when a second connection is established, they just switch back and forth, which can be very annoying.
- The instructor will walk through a demo of how to access and use the VMs
